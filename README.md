This folder contain code of aplication for theoretical optimization of optimal electric scooters collection.

**This is group work** of me and two of my colleagues, **Jakub Pud≈Ço** and **Hubert Sujka**.

To solve this problem we use simulated annealing algorithm.

Project is fully functional.

To run it user should open "main.py" file with Python 3.7 interpreter.
