# Cryostat-control

This folder contain data from my software for controlling and data acquisition of cryostat.

Shared code is mostly functional. I removed only dlls for controling external hardware because I don't know if licence enable sharing it with third parties.

Fully compiled executable(without mentioned dlls so on startup connection do devices must be set to off) can be found here:
